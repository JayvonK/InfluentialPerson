Project - Influential Person Website
Using mainly tailwind, I recreated a website that I created on figma, about and a person who I see as influential. I used a tiny bit of js, but other than that, everything was built using the tailwind css classes.

Peer Reviewer:Ashur
Peer Review: the website looks realy nice and responsive without any issue; figma desige matches the website but when i am playing the figma the footer is not showing up in the other pages, only on the homepage; overall well done and clean design

Edit: I went back and looked at my figma, I just had to enable overflow scrolling. Problem solved.
