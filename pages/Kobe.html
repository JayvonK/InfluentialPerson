      <p class="lg:hidden text-[23px] text-white font-Georgia leading-8 px-12">American professional basketball player Kobe Bean Bryant (pronounced /ˈkoʊbi/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was born. He played shooting guard in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Los Angeles Lakers for his whole 20-year career. Bryant, who is widely considered as one of the best players in NBA history, was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive team, the 2008 NBA MVP, and the MVP of the NBA Finals twice. He also won five NBA championships. Along with ranking fourth in the league's all-time regular season and postseason scoring, he also led the NBA in scoring twice. In 2020, he was inducted posthumously into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and listed on the 2021, the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. <br> <br>He was raised in Italy to some extent after being born in Philadelphia, the son of former NBA player Joe Bryant. Bryant entered the 1996 NBA draft after being named the best American high school basketball player while attending the Lower Merion suburb of Philadelphia. The Charlotte Hornets selected him with the 13th overall pick; he was later traded to the Lakers. He won the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest to establish his reputation as a high flyer as a rookie, and by the end of his second season, he had been named an All-Star. They had a falling out with Shaquille O'Neal, their teammate, but they still managed to lead the Lakers to three straight NBA titles from 2000 to 2002.</p>
